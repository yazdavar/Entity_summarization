# Entity_summarization

## Summary

Representing world knowledge in a machine processable format is important as entities and their descriptions have fueled tremendous growth in knowledge-rich information processing platforms, services, and systems. Prominent applications of knowledge graphs include search engines (eg, Google Search and Microsoft Bing), email clients (eg, Gmail), and intelligent personal assistants (eg, Google Now, Amazon Echo, and Appleâ€™s Siri). In this paper, we present an approach that can summarize facts about a collection of entities by analyzing their relatedness in preference to summarizing each entity in isolation. Specifically, we generate informative entity summaries by selecting:(i) inter-entity facts that are similar and (ii) intra-entity facts that are important and diverse.
